    <h1>Rules of Senior Assassin</h1>
    <h5>(Disclaimer! : By paying to be in this game, you are agreeing to all of the following rules. Breaking any rule will result in disqualification)</h5>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2> 
    <h5>For a legitimate “assassination,” video proof must be sent to both @siseniorassasin (Instagram)
        Team captains are chosen internally and are unknown to the rest of the teams participating; therefore, all members are considered potential targets. No repeated Captains. </h5>


<h2>Weapons: </h2>
<ul list-style = "none" style="font-weight: bold;">
    <li>Only WATER-based weapons (water guns, hoses, water balloons, water bottles…etc)</li>
        <li>No Nerf Guns</li>
        <li>No Splatterguns</li>
</ul>
<h2>Off-limit Zones</h2>
<div><img class = "map" src = "map.png"></div>
<h2>School</h2> 
<h5>Anywhere on the SI campus is strictly prohibited. 
Sidewalk in front of school (37th ave from Rivera to Pacheco).</h5>
<h2>Homes</h2> 
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
<li>You may NOT break into anyone’s home, even if you know how.</li>
<li>You can only enter a target’s home if a parent, legal guardian or trusted friend gives permission. The home includes a person’s garage and/or backyard </li>
<li>If any adult tells you to leave any time, do so IMMEDIATELY. This means getting completely off of their property. No hiding behind a car until they go back into their house.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2> 
<h5>Assassinations are not allowed in your target's workplace. Your target becomes safe as soon as he/she walks into his/her workplace, walking through the parking lot before or after is, however, fair game. (volunteer work is included)
No breaking any laws! (do you want to get arrested?)</h5>
